			<a id="diphthongs"><h2>Mobelish Diphthongs</h2></a>
			<p>What is a diphthong? A diphthong is a sound formed by a combination of two vowels. An English diphthong example would be the word "lie." The combination of the vowels "i" and "e" create a different sound than just pronouncing them next to each other. There are not many Mobelish diphthongs, but let's take a look at them.
			<dl>
				<dt><ins class="mobelish">- OH / oh</ins></dt>
				<dd>[ u:i: ] oo-ee</dd>
				<dt><ins class="mobelish">- YY / yy</ins><dt>
				<dd>[ ʍ ] w</dd>

			<a id="genders"><h2>Genders</h2></a>
			<p>The language of Mobelish has three genders. The masculine gender, the feminine gender, and the neutral gender. In their normal states, masculine nouns end in <ins class="mobelish">-ak</ins>, feminine nouns end in <ins class="mobelish">-om</ins>, and neuter nouns end in <ins class="mobelish">-el</ins>. All three genders decline differently.

			<a id="noun_declension"><h2>Noun Declension</h2></a>
			<p>What is declension? Declension is the state of changing a word based on how it's used. The declension of verbs is called <b>conjugation</b>. A good example of declension in English are the words "he", "him", and "his".
			<p>In Mobelish, nouns decline based on plurality and for the inclusion of the articles: "a", "an", "some", and "the".

					<td class="hidden">hello

			<p>For example, the word man - <ins class="mobelish">qresak</ins> - if you want to change it to <i>the </i>man, you have to add "<ins class="mobelish">ht</ins>" to make it definate (the man). It really is that simple!

			<a id="conjugation"><h2>Verb Conjugation</h2></a>
			<p><a href="conjugation.html">Full Mobelish Conjugation Chart</a> 
			<p>Noun declension was very simple, however, verb conjugation is not as simple. There are many conjugations, some including conjugated forms of other verbs. Mobelish has ten pronouns:
			<ul>
				<li>I - <ins class="mobelish">Omi</ins>
				<li>You - <ins class="mobelish">Ech</ins>
				<li>He - <ins class="mobelish">Tupa</ins>
				<li>She - <ins class="mobelish">Tupo</ins>
				<li>It - <ins class="mobelish">Tupe</ins>
				<li>We - <ins class="mobelish">Omhki</ins>
				<li>You/Y'all - <ins class="mobelish">Ecalh</ins>
				<li>They (m) - <ins class="mobelish">Tupoko</ins>
				<li>They (f) - <ins class="mobelish">Tuphmi</ins>
				<li>They (n) - <ins class="mobelish">Tupalo</ins>
			</ul>
			<p>For explanations, we are going to use the verb "<ins class="mobelish">fenzap</ins>," meaning to eat. The root of the verb is "<ins class="mobelish">fenz</ins>", and we are going to replace the -<ins class="mobelish">ap</ins> with other letters to conjugate. Let's learn to say "I eat". To conjugate the verb, you add -<ins class="mobelish">i</ins> to the root, creating the word "<ins class="mobelish">fenzi</ins>." Mobelish is a "pro-drop" language, meaning you can drop the pronoun in certain cases. Since the conjugation is different for each pronoun, you don't need to include it. However, if the subject is not a pronoun, but rather a noun instead, then you CANNOT take it out, like "the cat" or the combination of a noun and pronoun like "Mark and I."

			<a id="adjectives"><h2>Adjectives and Adverbs</h2></a>
			<p>Remember that in Mobelish there are three genders. Adjectives have different forms depending on what gender object they are being used on. The adjective happy, <ins class="mobelish">onle</ins>, will change based on what gender/number of objects it is describing.
			<table width="50%">
				<tr>
					<td class="hidden">boi
					<td><h4>Masculine</h4>
					<td><h4>Femenine</h4>
					<td><h4>Neuter</h4>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Singlular
					<td class="mobelish">onl<ins>a</ins>
					<td class="mobelish">onl<ins>o</ins>
					<td class="mobelish">onl<ins>e</ins>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td> Plural
					<td class="mobelish">onl<ins>ok</ins>
					<td class="mobelish">onl<ins>hm</ins>
					<td class="mobelish">onl<ins>al</ins>
				</tr>

			<p>The word for child in Mobelish is "<ins class="mobelish">xigel</ins>." So if you want to say "a happy man," you say "<ins class="mobelish">qresakzu onla.</ins>" Remember that nouns decline, and do note that the adjective comes after the noun. If you want to pluralize it, and say "some happy men," you would say "<ins class="mobelish">qresokozu onlok</ins>."
			<p>Mobelish adverbs are easy as well, and theres no declension needed! Just take the root of an adjective and add -<ins class="mobelish">eze</ins> to the end. So to say happily, you'd get the root of happy - <ins class="mobelish">onl</ins> - and add the suffix to create the word <ins class="mobelish">onleze</ins>. So to eat happily, you'd say "<ins class="mobelish">fenzi onleze</ins>." Notice again how the adverb is after the word it is affecting.

			<a id="phrases"><h2>Common Phrases</h2></a>
			<p>If you've just met up with you're friend, you'll most likely say "hi" to them. To say hi in Mobelish, you use the word <ins class="mobelish">vai</ins>. If you're meeting up with someone and want to say hi to them formally, you would say <ins class="mobelish">xelai</ins>. This is similar to English's "hello." If you want to ask someone how they are feeling at the moment, you would say "<ins class="mobelish">Nula ewek?</ins>" Be sure to use the verb <ins class="mobelish">fhwap</ins> because this has to deal with how the person is feeling. If you used the word <ins class="mobelish">jap</ins> and said, "<ins class="mobelish">Nula ajak?</ins>" than you would be asking what a person is like, what their qualities are.
