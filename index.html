			<p>The Mobelish alphabet has 26 letters just like English, but there is not a 1-to-1 ratio for letters. Let's take a look at the alphabet and find out what sounds every letter makes.</p>
			<p>The IPA symbols recently got updated! They're more accurate now wooo!

			<a id="diphthongs"><h2>Mobelish Pronunciations</h2></a>
			<p><b>Each letter in a Mobelish word is pronounced.</b> We don't do any of that nonsense like the word "face." /feɪs/. In Mobelish, if a word was <ins class="mobelish">fase</ins> it would be pronounced /'fase/. Notice how the vowel at the end is pronounced.
			<p>When pronouncing Mobelish words, it's important to know which syllable to stress. If the word has two syllables, stress the first one. If it has three or more, accent the second one.
			<p>Mobelish has a few diphtongs as well. A diphthong is a sound formed by a combination of two vowels. An English diphthong example would be the word "lie." The combination of the vowels "i" and "e" create a different sound than just pronouncing them next to each other. Let's take a look at Mobelish diphthongs.
			<dl>
				<dt><ins class="mobelish">- OH / oh</ins></dt>
				<dd>[ ʉi ] oo-ee</dd>
				<dt><ins class="mobelish">- YY / yy</ins><dt>
				<dd>[ w ] w</dd>
			</dl>

			<a id="noun_declension"><h2>Noun Declension</h2></a>
			<p>The language of Mobelish has three genders. The masculine gender, the feminine gender, and the neutral gender. In their normal states, masculine nouns end in <ins class="mobelish">-ak</ins>, feminine nouns end in <ins class="mobelish">-om</ins>, and neuter nouns end in <ins class="mobelish">-el</ins>. All three genders decline differently.
			<p>What is declension? Declension is the state of changing a word based on how it's used. The declension of verbs is called <b>conjugation</b>. A good example of declension in English are the words "he", "him", and "his".
			<p>In Mobelish, nouns decline based on plurality and for the inclusion of the articles: "a", "an", "some", and "the".

			<p>For example, the word man - <ins class="mobelish">qresak</ins> - ends in "<ins class="mobelish">ak</ins>" so it is a masculine noun. To make it definate (the man), replace the "<ins class="mobelish">ak</ins>" with "<ins class="mobelish">akht</ins>", making the word "<ins class="mobelish">qresakht</ins>."

			<a id="conjugation"><h2>Verb Conjugation</h2></a>
			<p><a href="conjugation.html">Full Mobelish Conjugation Chart</a> 
			<p>Noun declension was very simple, however, verb conjugation is not as simple. There are many conjugations, some including conjugated forms of other verbs. Mobelish has ten pronouns:
			<ul>
				<li>I - <ins class="mobelish">Omi</ins>
				<li>You - <ins class="mobelish">Ech</ins>
				<li>He - <ins class="mobelish">Tupa</ins>
				<li>She - <ins class="mobelish">Tupo</ins>
				<li>It - <ins class="mobelish">Tupe</ins>
				<li>We - <ins class="mobelish">Omhki</ins>
				<li>You/Y'all - <ins class="mobelish">Ecalh</ins>
				<li>They (m) - <ins class="mobelish">Tupoko</ins>
				<li>They (f) - <ins class="mobelish">Tuphmi</ins>
				<li>They (n) - <ins class="mobelish">Tupalo</ins>
			</ul>
			<p>For explanations, we are going to use the verb "<ins class="mobelish">fenzap</ins>," meaning to eat. The root of the verb is "<ins class="mobelish">fenz</ins>", and we are going to replace the -<ins class="mobelish">ap</ins> with other letters to conjugate. Let's learn to say "I eat". To conjugate the verb, you add -<ins class="mobelish">i</ins> to the root, creating the word "<ins class="mobelish">fenzi</ins>." Mobelish is a "pro-drop" language, meaning you can drop the pronoun in certain cases. Since the conjugation is different for each pronoun, you don't need to include it. However, if the subject is not a pronoun, but rather a noun instead, then you CANNOT take it out, like "the cat" or the combination of a noun and pronoun like "Mark and I."

			<a id="adjectives"><h2>Adjectives and Adverbs</h2></a>
			<p>Remember that in Mobelish there are three genders. Adjectives have different forms depending on what gender object they are being used on. The adjective happy, <ins class="mobelish">onle</ins>, will change based on what gender/number of objects it is describing.
			<table width="50%">
				<tr>
					<td class="hidden">boi
					<td><h4>Masculine</h4>
					<td><h4>Femenine</h4>
					<td><h4>Neuter</h4>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Singlular
					<td class="mobelish">onl<ins>a</ins>
					<td class="mobelish">onl<ins>o</ins>
					<td class="mobelish">onl<ins>e</ins>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td> Plural
					<td class="mobelish">onl<ins>ok</ins>
					<td class="mobelish">onl<ins>hm</ins>
					<td class="mobelish">onl<ins>al</ins>
				</tr>

			<p>The word for child in Mobelish is "<ins class="mobelish">xigel</ins>." So if you want to say "a happy man," you say "<ins class="mobelish">qresakzu onla.</ins>" Remember that nouns decline, and do note that the adjective comes after the noun. If you want to pluralize it, and say "some happy men," you would say "<ins class="mobelish">qresokozu onlok</ins>."
			<p>Mobelish adverbs are easy as well, and theres no declension needed! Just take the root of an adjective and add -<ins class="mobelish">eze</ins> to the end. So to say happily, you'd get the root of happy - <ins class="mobelish">onl</ins> - and add the suffix to create the word <ins class="mobelish">onleze</ins>. So to eat happily, you'd say "<ins class="mobelish">fenzi onleze</ins>." Notice again how the adverb is after the word it is affecting.

			<a id="phrases"><h2>Common Phrases</h2></a>
			<p>If you've just met up with you're friend, you'll most likely say "hi" to them. To say hi in Mobelish, you use the word <ins class="mobelish">vai</ins>. If you're meeting up with someone and want to say hi to them formally, you would say <ins class="mobelish">xelai</ins>. This is similar to English's "hello." If you want to ask someone how they are feeling at the moment, you would say "<ins class="mobelish">Nula ewek?</ins>" Be sure to use the verb <ins class="mobelish">fhwap</ins> because this has to deal with how the person is feeling. If you used the word <ins class="mobelish">jap</ins> and said, "<ins class="mobelish">Nula ajak?</ins>" than you would be asking what a person is like, what their qualities are.

			<h2 id="colors">Mobelish Colors</h2>
			<p>Mobelish colors are pretty simple. They act just as normal adjectives most of the time. To say "the red brick" you would say "<ins class="mobelish">phtakht asta</ins>." Pretty simple stuff. If you want to use colors like light blue, you combine the color and the word light, so light blue would be "<ins class="mobelish">jeme olaqe</ins>." <ins class="mobelish">aste olaqe</ins> translates to "pink" because that's the English word for light red. It's pretty much the same for dark colors as well. Remember that dark orange is brown in English.
			<p>When using the light or dark variant of the color, be sure to make both adjectives are in the correct gender and quantity. Dark red bricks would translate to "<ins class="mobelish">phtoko astok xiskok</ins>."
